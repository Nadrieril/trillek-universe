trillek-universe
================
Space simulator base for Trillek.
Handles the simulation of celestial bodies orbiting each other (stricly keplerian orbits for now).

TODO:
 - Random orbits generation
 - Entire planetary system generation
 - Non-keplerian orbits and transition to and from keplerian orbits when necessary (patched conic approximation)

The codes handles 3D, but the demo is a simple SDL 2D test.
